## Where it all started.

In this blog I am going to try and cover my college days experiences and what I have learnt and implimented, this blog will be encompassing my Gradutation days experiences since it's still fresh in my memory.

Let's first establish a soft roadmap over the things I've been to get a head's up for what's coming up.

**Things I've been upto in college**

* Student Coordinator, Coding Club - HITAM
* Head of Google Technologies - GDSC HITAM
* Student Faculty - SSG HITAM
* Student Dean Doing Engineering - SSG HITAM

These experiences on a great part wouldn't have been possible if not for the nurturing and progressive environment of **[Hyderabad Institute of Technology and Management](https://www.linkedin.com/school/hitamhyderabad/posts/?feedView=all)**. And also because of the supportive friends, and seniors I came across who belived in me specially at times when I didn't belived in myself.

People are a great part all the things you do in college, the one's who support you and especially the one's who stand in your way making you question about yourself.

## Being Coordinator at 2nd year in college

So if you don't know this there is a concept of either going the normal way doing intermediate and enter the engineering path, and also there is this method of getting a diploma and entering the world of under-grad engineering where you don't have to do 1st year of college instead enter at 2nd year of the course. The work becomes cut out for you don't have to do all of that physics and chem at your late teens instead you can just focus the engineering concepts.

But with it's up's there is a significant down to the whole thing, that all the folks have already jelled and it becomes difficult to enter social groups and setting. It's not bad on a great scale but has a **make or break** phase to it where you decide who you wanna be. Either shelled up or go out with your social ammo on people, the approach I chose was the later one. I tried to talk to folks and explain 'em who I am and asking is there a way to find like minded people.

Afer asking a handful of people you understand which place you want to be at, It takes a while before people start noticing and give you responsibilities. It took a while for me too, where after getting responsibilty of being the Head of Technologies at GDSC HITAM I was called upon to head one of the affinity clubs of our college, where the club which was started by our super - seniors(allegedly the right term). Where this club has seen a down time, and we were supposed to revive it and get it up and running, with another guy who was my Coordinator-mate.

### Things we did

We just got up and running, and held our first session about version-control. where we were quite a hit, but I made a lot of mistakes as speaker, I understood that it is not about what you want to explain, but is about how much the audience, can comprehend and gain from it.

Then there was another issue I faced, was sharing of responsibilities where my mate was preparing for a significant exam, and has said he wouldn't be able to contribute much. And I myself had all the time in the world and wanted to weave this community in my college which will all about coding. So instead of shying away and letting him be a silent mate, I made sure he was leaving the post and giving me flexibility of what I wanted to do with the club.

Then the stream roller started, first of all I wanted all the social media access, and wanted to make sure of everything we do is going to be accessable and could be followed, so I got us various social media profiles, and also made a website which can be used to understand the sessions. It was the most inspiring work I have done, with the least experience and as it goes, it was not a very efficient work.

During my stint as a Coordinator, After organising a handful of sessions, I was trying to come up  with a team to keep on with the sessions, and to manage all the terinary works and turned out I was pretty bad at it, I was not able to communicate and forge a relation of trust and passsion, which I belived in. What ended up happening was team members were not incentivized to conduct a session and attract a lot of participant which caused us to blow off into the dust.

Things I learnt were, if you create a team develop a synergy with them and have them on the same wavelength, and also while organizing bigger events don't loose a touch of your community and manage the work. And if people don't show up in huge numbers doesn't mean you should stop rather make the session and interaction useful for the one's who showed up.
