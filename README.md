# Anirban.codes

[![Live Site](https://img.shields.io/badge/site-live-brightgreen)](https://www.anirban.space/)

It is a repository for the code of the portfolio of Anirban Sikdar(me). The live server is at [anirban.space](anirban.space).

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

## Tailwind CSS

As part of the development it also has Tailwind CSS integrated to the project you can checkout the local configurations at [tsconfig.json](tsconfig.json).

As tailwind CSS is a Mobile oriented styling framework it has been difficult, and a grave mistake to start from developing from the desktop then back to a responsive view of the site.

This page supports both Desktop and Mobile view. You can checkout the crazy framework of tailwind here at [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) âœ¨âœ¨.

## UI/UX

Designing a project before developing the frontend really help and in this project I have learnt a handful of UI/UX. Skills and can brag about it so check them out here [WireFrames](https://www.figma.com/file/UaF8U2ntQDSajEHV6K8gK0/Portfolio?type=design&t=FcqbpQPlOKtMDQSt-6).
